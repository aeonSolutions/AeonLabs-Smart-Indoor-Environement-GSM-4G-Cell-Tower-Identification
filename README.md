# Smart Indoor Environment GSM 4G Cell Tower Identification

**The Problem**
Nowadays is very convenient to have a wireless 4G internet connection everywhere, including at home, or at the office. Also, a widely known technique for stealing one's GSM communications data includes some kind of hidden GSM/4G device repeater able to perform Man-in-the-middle¬†attacks. This attack technique allows one to collect and intercept data communications between a GSM/4G device, for instance, a smartphone or a tablet by impersonating a GSM Cell tower. 

**The Idea**

This Smart Indoor Env. GSM Cell Tower Monitor is built to do active monitoring of GSM Cell Towers nearby to look for any kind of hidden GSM/4G device repeater. Known to be used for stealing one's GSM communications data using some kind of Man-in-the-middle attack. This smart device is able to retrieve each GSM Cell tower Radio Signal strength, and the corresponding GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude), and do a Cell Tower Location match using a service called ‚ÄúOpenCellID‚Äù. OpenCellID.org is an open source database of CellID, serving two purposes:

- Everybody can create an application gathering information about cell locations, and send this information to the OpenCellID server, improving the coverage
- The database can be used by other applications to get the location of a cell, according to its cell id.

 source: https://arduino-projects4u.com/gsm-locator/
 
</p>

Basically it means you can use this info to create a GSM locator. So where can you find the location of the antennas. There are two sites worth mentioning although the second one seems to be going under.
- ~~[http://www.opencellid.org/cell/map](http://www.opencellid.org/cell/map)~~
- [www.celldb.org](http://www.celldb.org)

This smart device is able to do GSM/4G radio frequency (RF) measurements in a room and send data measurements to a local home server, alternatively to a public cloud server, for instance, to the authorities on a data repository ( see http://wwww.dataverse.org). Another important characteristic of this smart device is in the ability to deliver data to a server with a Unique Data Fingerprint Identification (UDF-ID), which makes collected data more trustworthy of its origins.
